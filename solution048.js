// Below, find the mix-ups that have been made. Note: the confusion happened in both directions and was case-sensitive.

// '0' <-> 'O'      '5' <-> 'S'
// '1' <-> 'I'      '6' <-> 'G'
// '2' <-> 'Z'      '7' <-> 'L'
// '3' <-> 'E'      '8' <-> 'B'
// '4' <-> 'h'      '9' <-> 'q'

// As an example, here is how a string looks before and after the characters are fixed:

// "PR0-T1P #hqB: 1T'5 N1C3 T0 5AY H3770." 
// // implement fix function -> 
// "PRO-TIP #498: IT'S NICE TO SAY HELLO."

let num = ['0','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9']

function fixStr(num) {
    if num.includes()
}
