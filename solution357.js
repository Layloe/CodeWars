// Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

// You can return the answer in any order.

function twoSum(nums, target) { 

} 
console.log(twoSum([2,7,11,15]))

//Input: an array of numbers, and a target number; nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

//Output: An array of two numbers

// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
// Output: [1,2]

//Use nested loops to compare each value in the array against all other values to see if they add up to target, then when they do return the index of the values.
