// Description:
// Given the following input array:

var list1 = [
  { firstName: 'Emily', lastName: 'N.', country: 'Ireland', continent: 'Europe', age: 30, language: 'Ruby' },
  { firstName: 'Nor', lastName: 'E.', country: 'Malaysia', continent: 'Asia', age: 20, language: 'Clojure' }
];
// write a function that adds the username property to each object in the input array:

[
  { firstName: 'Emily', lastName: 'N.', country: 'Ireland', continent: 'Europe', age: 30, language: 'Ruby', 
    username: 'emilyn1990' },
  { firstName: 'Nor', lastName: 'E.', country: 'Malaysia', continent: 'Asia', age: 20, language: 'Clojure', 
    username: 'nore2000' }
]
// The value of the username property is composed by concatenating:

// firstName in lower-case;
// first letter of the lastName in lower-case; and
// the birth year which for the purpose of this kata is calculated simply by subtracting age from the current year. Please make sure that your function delivers the correct birth year irrespective of when it will be executed, for example it should also work correctly for a meetup organised in 10-years-time. The example above assumes that the function is run in year 2020.
// Notes:

// The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.
// Age is represented by a number which can be any positive integer.
// Lastname will always be one upper-cased letter followed by dot, e.g. 'N.'
// Order of the objects in the array should be maintained but order of the properties in the individual objects does not matter.

function addUsername(list) {
  let results = []
  const findData = list.map(item => {
    results.push({
      firstName: item.firstName,
      lastName: item.lastName,
      age: item.age
    })
  })
  
  return results
}
console.log(addUsername(list1))
// Input is an array of objects. 
// Output is first name in lowercase, first letter of last name in lowercase and birth year concatenating.
// Example above.
// Create a var to push results to. Then map through array to push first name and first letter of last name. Then decide if I want to do the math of birth year in push or post in return. //! Extract values of results and lowercase to one string for each object
