// Our football team has finished the championship.

// Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

// For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

// Points are awarded for each match as follows:

// if x > y: 3 points (win)
// if x < y: 0 points (loss)
// if x = y: 1 point (tie)
// We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

// Notes:

// our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
// 0 <= x <= 4
// 0 <= y <= 4

// Parameters: an arr of strs in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

// Return: the number of points (x) got

// Example:
// assert.strictEqual(points(["1:0","2:0","3:0","4:0","2:1","3:1","4:1","3:2","4:2","4:3"]) , 30);
// assert.strictEqual(points(["1:1","2:2","3:3","4:4","2:2","3:3","4:4","3:3","4:4","4:4"]) , 10);
// assert.strictEqual(points(["0:1","0:2","0:3","0:4","1:2","1:3","1:4","2:3","2:4","3:4"]) , 0);
// assert.strictEqual(points(["1:0","2:0","3:0","4:0","2:1","1:3","1:4","2:3","2:4","3:4"]) , 15);
// assert.strictEqual(points(["1:0","2:0","3:0","4:4","2:2","3:3","1:4","2:3","2:4","3:4"]) , 12);

// Psuedocode: loop through arr, deconstruct and use condtionals then add the logic:
// if x > y: 3 points (win)
// if x < y: 0 points (loss)
// if x = y: 1 point (tie)

const points=games=>games.reduce((output,current)=>{
    return output += current[0]>current[2] ? 3 : current[0]===current[2] ? 1 : 0;
  },0)

// function points(games) {

//     const testSum = games.reduce((sum,item) => {
//         const arrSplit = item().split(':')
//     })
//     return testSum
//   }
