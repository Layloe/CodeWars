//Input is going to be passing in a number. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

//Return an integer > 0 that is a sum of the integers from 1 to num

//i.e.,
// 2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
// 8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)

//Declare a variable to hold a counter 
//Loop through each integer up to but not exceeding the value num
//use a for loop starting at 1 and going up to the value 
//inside of each loop add the current integer value to the running total
