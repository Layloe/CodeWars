// Systematic debugging If your code doesn't work as expected:
// The goal is to find the first place where the code deviates from your mental model of what the code is supposed to do
// Add print statements / console logging to help isolate the deviation
// Use minimal test inputs, so the debugging messages aren't overwhelming
// Never make random changes to misbehaving code in the hopes that that will fix it. Always:
// Have a hypothesis for why a change to your code will fix the problem
// Implement the change
// Test the change to confirm your hypothesis
