//Given a number as an input, print out every integer from 1 to that number. However, when the integer is divisible by 3, print out “Fizz”; when it’s divisible by 5, print out “Buzz”; when it’s divisible by both 3 and 5, print out “Fizz Buzz”.

//num -> to that num -> div 3 fiz; div 3/5 fizz buzz
//always int; pos; no floats; int always 
//print to console; notes 

function fizzBuzz(num) {

fizzBuzz(5) //1, 2, fizz,4,buzz
fizzBuzz(9) //1,2,fizz,4,buzz.fizz,7,8,fizz
fizzBuzz(15) //1,2,fizz,4,buzz,7, 8, fizz, buzz,13,14,fizzbuzz
